## Oracle Pro Monitoring features

WhaTap's Oracle Pro monitoring products presents an innovation that goes beyond the traditional query-based data collection. Traditional query-based approaches place significant load on the database server, which can cause system performance degradation. This approach uses the Direct Memory Access (DMA) technique to directly access the server's memory and extract the required data, thereby placing little load on the database server. This is a huge advantage, especially in high-performance database environments.

Additionally, query-based collection methods have long data update cycles and can collect data only at specific query execution times. In comparison, the Oracle Pro monitoring can collect data almost in real time through memory access, and can collect sessions and SQL performance data at an interval of at least 0.01 seconds. This allows database administrators to monitor the system performance more precisely and respond immediately when any problem occurs.

Another important feature of the Oracle Pro monitoring product is that data collection is not interrupted even in a system failure or hang. Data collection in these scenarios can be difficult using traditional query-based approaches. By using Oracle Pro, database administrators can ensure data continuity under any circumstances, thereby maximizing the stability and availability of the system.

Ultimately, WhaTap's Oracle Pro monitoring product is an essential technology for improving the efficiency and accuracy of database monitoring, while minimizing system load and ensuring business continuity. This provides a foundation for companies to make faster, more accurate, and more reliable decisions.

- **Memory access method**

  WhaTap Oracle Pro collects data by directly accessing the DB server memory using the **Direct Memory Access** (DMA) technology. It overcomes the limitations of the existing query methods and provides fast and efficient data collection without server overload.

- **Load-free monitoring data collection**

  Oracle Pro accesses the DB server memory directly to extract data, and collects the performance data 20 times per second with little server load. This supports stable and efficient monitoring even in high-performance DB environments.

- **Precise SQL performance data collection**

  Oracle Pro collects data 20 times per second, enabling precise analysis and providing much more detailed information than the 5-second interval SQL collection of the existing query-based method. This allows administrators to identify issues in real time and respond immediately.

- **Monitoring analysis possible even when the DB is in Hang status**

  Oracle Pro does not stop collecting data even in case of DB failure or hang situations. This ensures data continuity and enables analysis and response even upon a failure, maximizing the system stability and availability.
