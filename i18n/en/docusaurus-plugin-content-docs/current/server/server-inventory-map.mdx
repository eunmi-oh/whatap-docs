On the initial screen of the WhaTap monitoring service, select a project, and then select the <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" /> menu under the <Cmdname sid="side_dashboard" className="uitext" /> menu. <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" /> is a visualization dashboard that allows administrators to group and organize servers based on the classification criteria for monitoring purposes based on <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventory" className="uitext" />. 

WhaTap allows users to intuitively check and analyze the server operation status through <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" />. The administrators can add and manage the user-defined information such as work classification, person in charge, and server location as custom columns, and easily create visualized dashboards based on this. <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" /> also provides the grouping feature to meet different perspectives for monitoring purposes. Improve the server operation management efficiency through <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" />.

{/* 

Additionally, it provides the group-specific summary and information details to help run the infrastructure efficiently.

Simplify the server operation management by using the server inventory map and visually provide key metrics to simultaneously improve the infrastructure management efficiency and operation productivity.

### ![1](/img/number-01.png) User configuration

<Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" /> provides several custom settings that allow you to configure the desired dashboard. You can use the following features.

#### Real-time inquiry and pausing

<Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" /> is basically based on the real-time inquiry. For real-time inquiry and pausing status change, use the time selector on the upper left of the screen.

| Lookup status            | Description                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Real-time inquiry (Live) | Basic mode<br/>Interval: 5 seconds |
| Pause inquiry (Pause)    | Real-time status change to OFF     |

#### Grouping

{/* 1. 업무그룹 대 - 업무 그룹 중 (활용 예시)(나중에 12월?)
2. Infrastructure domain - Work group major (11 guidance method upon release) (English groups to be provided up to major level) */}

<Columns>

<Column className="text--left width--20">

<ImgLang img='server-inventory-map-group-select.png' desc='Server inventory map select grouping' />

</Column>

<Column className="text--left">

<Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" /> provides the ***grouping*** feature that can systematically classify the servers. Manage servers effectively by setting the grouping criteria depending on the monitoring purpose and environment.

Based on <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventory" className="uitext" />, the default collection items and custom items among the columns that can be searched appear in the ***Grouping*** list. The default collection items are ***server type***, ***default group***, ***OS type***, ***OS version***, ***model***, and ***serial***. Other items that can be seen in the example image are custom columns (<code class='custom-cl'>custom</code>) that are user-defined items.

You can classify servers by selecting ***1st group*** and ***2nd group*** sequentially. According to the primary and secondary grouping, in the ![Leader line 3](/img/number-03.png) area, the ***primary group*** classifies the data in card format, and the ***secondary group*** represents each grouped data in subgroup format in the chart area within cards. 

</Column>

</Columns>

{/* 

Primary group: group, Secondary group: sub group, card

Cards are for group summary information, server group charts, and server group metrics information summaries. 

*/}

{/* 

Primary group - group, secondary group - sub group

You can classify servers by selecting ***1st group*** and ***2nd group*** sequentially. 

Panels are created in the grid area for each group. Secondary group is for group grid. 

When grouped, data is visually displayed in the group grid area of ​​the ![Leader line 3](/img/number-03.png) chart. 2차 그룹은 

It displays servers grouped in detail within the primary group, represented as a list of servers distinguished by the chart and border. 

*/}

:::note 

For more information about ***grouping***, see [the following](server-inventory-map-group).

#### Filtering

<Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" /> provides the feature to filter the server types to display on the dashboard. Data applied through filtering is reflected into the server group chart, summary view, and detailed view.

- ***Filter key***: Filters can be set based on the default collection columns provided in the <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventory" className="uitext" /> menu and user-defined custom columns.

  - Default collection columns: Items automatically collected from <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventory" className="uitext" /> are ***server type***, ***default group***, ***OS type***, ***OS version***, ***model***, and ***serial*** columns.

  - Custom columns: They are the items added and managed on a project basis.

- ***Filter condition***: Filter conditions can be set as string conditions such as matched, mismatched, included, and excluded. All filters are string-based, and numeric conditions (e.g. `≥`, `≤`) are not supported.

### ![2](/img/number-02.png) Server configuration status

<Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" /> provides the server configuration status that allows you to check the configurations for each server operating system of the project at a glance at the top of the dashboard. This allows users to get a quick and intuitive overview of key information about servers in the project.

- ***OS***: This server operating system displays the OS name along with its OS icon. If an OS that is not predefined is included, the infrastructure icon appears by default.

- ***Total / Active***: This indicates the total number of servers included in the project and the number of active servers.

### ![3](/img/number-03.png) Server group card

<Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" /> provides individual cards based on the grouped server configuration. The <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" /> card consists of three major elements as follows.

{/* <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" />은 그룹화 한 서버 구성 정보별로 카드를 제공합니다. When grouping is not applied, all server information is displayed within a single card. When applying grouping, cards are organized by each group unit. The card in <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" /> consists of the following three elements.  */}

### Group Info

In the <Cmdname sid="group_info" className="uitext" /> tab, you can effectively check the main operation status and resources of the selected server group as follows.

{/* 서버 업타임 */}

#### <Cmdname sid="TTL08660" className="uitext" />

It divides the operation period into sections since the server booting and visualizes the number of servers in the section in bar chart format. When a bar chart is selected, the detailed information of servers belonging to the section is highlighted in the <Cmdname sid="TTL08767" className="uitext" /> list below. If you click the same bar chart, the selection is released. 

{/* 

Displaying counts for each operation period section:

- The number of servers in the corresponding section is visualized in the bar chart format by dividing the sections based on the elapsed operation period since the server booting.

- Interaction feature:

- When you click on a bar chart, the details of the servers belonging to the corresponding section appear in the server configuration table below, with the selected items highlighted.

- If you click the same bar chart again, the selection is released.

This allows the administrators to intuitively check the server uptime distribution and easily check server information that belongs to a specific section. 

*/}

{/* 서버 인벤토리 */}

#### <Cmdname sid="TTL08767" className="uitext" />
