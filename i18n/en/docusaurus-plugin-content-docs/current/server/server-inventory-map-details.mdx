Home &gt; Select Project &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_dashboard" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" />

You can check detailed information about the server group selected from the <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" /> menu on the ***Display Detail*** screen. Click ![Display Detail icon](/img/ico-detail-mode.svg) ***Display Detail*** on the upper right of the **View summary** panel. The server group information in Display Detail is updated in real time.

<ImgLang img='server-inventory-map-details.png' desc='Server inventory map view detail' />

- You can check the group data query time and refresh cycle through the **time selector** at the top, and you can stop or resume refreshing data. 

- In the left area, you can see the **server group cards** and **server list**.

- In each tab on the right, you can see the ***server inventory***, ***file system information***, and ***metrics information***. 

## Server group cards and list

Key summary information on the selected server group can be viewed through the server group cards and list. 

- If you hover the mouse over a server in the chart area within the server group card, a popover with summary information of the selected server appears. 

- You can specify a target server to query from the chart area and server list within the server group card. 

- You can select up to 10 servers, and you can check information of the selected server in each tab on the right when you select a target server. 

## Server Inventory

You can check the detailed configuration of the selected server in list format in the <Cmdname sid="TTL08767" className="uitext" /> tab. If no server is selected, the server configuration information for all servers in the server group appears. The information and configuration that can be viewed in the <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventory" className="uitext" /> menu are the same. 

### Filtering

{/* 필터 설정 시 드로워 제거가 안되어서 바로 추가가 안됨.. */}

The <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventory" className="uitext" /> menu provides the server filtering feature based on the column list set in the menu.

- ***Filter key***: Filters can be set based on the default collection columns provided in the <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventory" className="uitext" /> menu and user-defined custom columns.

  - Default collection columns: Items automatically collected from <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventory" className="uitext" /> are ***server type***, ***default group***, ***OS type***, ***OS version***, ***model***, and ***serial*** columns.

  - Custom columns: They are the items added and managed on a project basis.

- ***Filter condition***: Filter conditions can be set as string conditions such as matched, mismatched, included, and excluded. All filters are string-based, and numeric conditions (e.g. `≥`, `≤`) are not supported.

### Column Settings
