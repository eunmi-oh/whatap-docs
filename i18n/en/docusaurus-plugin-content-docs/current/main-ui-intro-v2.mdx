### Project view {#projectview}

You can see the project list in three view modes as follows: Check the overall project status by selecting the mode for your purpose.

<ImgLang img='ui-home/main-project-select-view.png' desc='Select view' />

#### <LinkImage img="ico-extend-card-view.svg" className="ico" /> <Cmdname sid="wide_card_view" />

<ImgLang img='ui-home/main-project-extend-card-view.png' desc='Wide card view' />

The default view mode. At this time, the unit in which individual projects are displayed is referred to as **project card**. Key metrics and properties being collected by the project's agents appear on each project card. This allows you to quickly see the performance status of the project.

#### <LinkImage img="ico-reduction-view.svg" className="ico" /> <Cmdname sid="compact_card_view" />

<ImgLang img='ui-home/main-project-compact-card-view.png' desc='Wide card view' />

Individual projects provide information less than <Cmdname sid="wide_card_view" className="uitext" />, which provides a larger list of projects.

#### <LinkImage img="ico-list-view.svg" className="ico" /> <Cmdname sid="project_list_view" />

<ImgLang img='ui-home/main-project-list-card-view.png' desc='List view' />

Projects are classified depending on the product type and displayed in the list format. The displayed information may differ depending on the product type. The rightmost part in the list provides the project management (![Configuration icon](/img/ico-setting.svg)) and deletion (![Delete icon](/img/ico-trash.svg)) functions.

### Viewing the favorite project list {#favoritedproject}

In three view modes, only the projects set as ![Favorite icon](/img/ico-favorite-set.svg) (Favorite) can appear in the list.

Select ![Favorite icon](/img/ico-favorite.svg) in the project card to set a favorite. You can select multiple projects. On the right of the project search field, select the ![favorite icon](/img/ico-favorite.svg)(<Cmdname sid="favorite" className="uitext" />) mode.

<ImgLang img='ui-home/main-project-favorite-list.png' desc='Favorite' />

### Searching by the project/project code {#searchprojectwithcode}

If you have trouble finding a project because there are many managed or owned projects, use the search function. You can filter the projects to search. Enter the project name or project code in the project search field at the top of the screen. 

<ImgLang img='ui-home/main-project-filter.png' className="width-200" />

Below the input field, a list of projects that match the specified string appears. Select a desired project. With the string entered, press the Enter key or select ![Search icon](/img/ico-search.svg). The projects that match the entered string appear in the list.
