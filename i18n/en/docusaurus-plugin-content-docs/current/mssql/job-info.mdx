The following provides information about jobs executed by SQL Server. The <UI>Job</UI> section at the top of the screen displays the entire job list and related information, while the <UI>Job History</UI> section at the bottom provides the detailed execution history of the job selected at the top. This allows you to manage the jobs and monitor their execution status.

- If a job fails, analyze the failed step and message to resolve the issue. For example, you can identify the database connection problems or script errors.

- You can analyze the `run_duration` to optimize the steps with long execution times or consider parallel execution.

- You can check inactive jobs and activate them if necessary or delete unnecessary jobs to improve the management efficiency.

:::note

- A **Job** is a unit of work managed by **SQL Server Agent** and it is a process that is configured to automatically perform specific tasks (e.g. database backup, data cleanup, query execution). **Job** is useful for automating tasks that need to be performed repeatedly or at regular intervals. For more information, see the [following link](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/agent/create-a-job?view=sql-server-ver16).

- Jobs are supported in SQL Server 2016 or later, and are not supported in the Express version.
