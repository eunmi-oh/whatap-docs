<Title hashid='anlaysis-trace' level={props.level}>Analyzing a trace</Title>

Select an item to view details from the transaction list. On the right of the screen, the detailed analysis of the selected transaction appears. In this state, if another transaction item is selected, the detailed analysis of the selected transaction item is changed.

To analyze the transaction performance, WhaTap collects and displays the properties such as name and client data, transaction performance, and detailed execution records for each section.

- In the ![Number 5](/img/number-05.png) area, the step data can be seen in various formats. Select a desired type of tab.

- In the ![number 6](/img/number-06.png) area, you can see the basic information for transactions. The information matches the columns in the list on the left.

- ![Number 7](/img/number-07.png) ![Statistics icon](/img/ic-static.svg): The statistical data window for the corresponding URL or each execution section appears. Click a desired time on the graph chart in the statistical data window to go to <Cmdname sid="side_statistics" className="uitext" /> or <Cmdname sid="side_txSearch" className="uitext" />. You can view the statistical data based on the selected time.
