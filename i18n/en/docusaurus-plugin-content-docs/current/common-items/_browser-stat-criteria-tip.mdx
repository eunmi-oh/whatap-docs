- <Cmdname sid="merge_avg" className="uitext" /> is useful for getting an overall performance status, but it can be difficult to detect cases where performance degradation occurs intermittently. At this time, by using the <Cmdname sid="merge_max" className="uitext" /> and <Cmdname sid="ITM08291" className="uitext" /> options together, you can check the time when the performance degradation occurred and how severe it was.

- <Cmdname sid="merge_min" className="uitext" /> can be used as a reference when setting the performance optimization goals or evaluating how effective a specific optimization is. However, because it is difficult to evaluate the consistency of performance with this value alone, it is recommended to analyze the statistical data together with the <Cmdname sid="merge_avg" className="uitext" /> or <Cmdname sid="ITM08291" className="uitext" /> option.

- The <Cmdname sid="ITM08291" className="uitext" /> option is ideal for analyzing performance data at a more precise level than simple averages, providing valuable data for improving user experience. This option allows you to identify the percentage of users experiencing performance degradation and effectively select the target pages to optimize.
