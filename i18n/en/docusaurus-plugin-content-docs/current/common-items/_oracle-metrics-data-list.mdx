| Metrics                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `buffer cache hit ratio`      | The number of times the data can be found directly in memory without reading it from the disk <br/>. A high number indicates a good database performance, while a low number indicates the increased disk I/O, which may cause poor performance.                                                      |
| `soft parse ratio`            | SQL statements reuse frequency, <br/>Soft Parse is that a SQL statement that is in the cache is reused. A high value indicates that SQL statement are being reused frequently.                                                                                                                        |
| `hard parse ratio`            | Parsed frequency of the SQL statements from scratch.<br/> A hard parse occurs when a SQL statement is run for the first time or when it does not exist in the cache. If this figure is high, it may increase the CPU usage of the database and result in poor performance.                            |
| `library cache hit ratio`     | The percentage of successful search of SQL and PL/SQL statements from the Library Cache. <br/> A high number indicates that SQL statements and PL/SQL code are being reused effectively in the cache.                                                                                                 |
| `library cache pin hit ratio` | Percentage of successful Library Cache Pin requests. <br/>The Library Cache Pin protects running SQL statements from being changed by other sessions. A high number indicates that this protection is effective.                                                                                      |
| `library cache get hit ratio` | If the rate of successful retrieval of objects from the Library Cache <br/> is a high number, it indicates that SQL statements and PL/SQL code are being reused effectively in the Library Cache.                                                                                                     |
| `latch hit ratio`             | The rate of successful latch requests <br/>, latch is a locking mechanism for controlling access to shared memory in the database. A high number indicates a low latch latency and good concurrency and performance of the system.                                                                    |
| `shared pool free mem ratio`  | The percentage of Free Memory in the Shared Pool <br/>. The shared pool is a memory area that stores SQL statements, PL/SQL code, and the data dictionary cache. If an appropriate amount of free memory is maintained, it can ensure efficient operation of the shared pool and optimal performance. |
