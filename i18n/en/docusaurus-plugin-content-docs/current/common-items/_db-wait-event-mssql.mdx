### wait_type {#waittype}

The `wait_type` column is a value that indicates a specific resource or event on which a query or transaction is waiting in **SQL Server**. **SQL Server** uses various wait types internally to manage the system performance and diagnose problems.

#### I/O-related waits

- `PAGEIOLATCH_EX`: It waits for an exclusive lock to read a data page.

- `PAGEIOLATCH_SH`: It waits for a shared lock to read a data page.

- `FILEIO`: It waits for a file I/O operation.

#### Lock-related waits

- `LCK_M_X`: Exclusive lock wait.

- `LCK_M_S`: Shared lock wait.

- `LCK_M_U`: Update lock wait.

- `RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE`': Resource semaphore wait when waiting to acquire memory resources.

#### Other waits

- `CKPACKET`: Inter-thread synchronization wait in parallel queries.

- `ASYNC_NETWORK_IO`: It is waiting for the network I/O operations.

- `SLEEP_*`: It is waiting due to a `WAITFOR` or `WAITFOR DELAY` statement.

- `BROKER_*` : It waits for a service broker message.

- `LOCK_MANAGER`: Lock management waits and the waits related to the lock manager in **SQL Server**.

### wait_resource {#waitsresource}

The `wait_resource` column provides information about the resource on which a request running in **SQL Server** is waiting. A string for a request waiting for a specific resource indicates the specific ID or location of the resource being waited for.

For key resource types and examples, see the following:

- `PAGE: <file_id>:<page_id>`

  It indicates a wait for a data page. 

  > e.g. `PAGE: 1:12345`

- `FILE: <file_id>`

  It indicates a wait for the entire data file.

  > e.g. `FILE: 1`

- `0BJECT: <cobject_id>`

  It indicates a wait for a specific table.

  > e.g. `0BJECT: 123456`

- `DATABASE: <database_id>`

  It indicates a wait for a specific database.

  > e.g. `DATABASE: 5`

- `KEY: <key_id>`

  It indicates a wait for an index key or a key of another data structure.

  > e.g. `KEY: 67890`

- `RID: <file_id>:<page_id>:<row_id>`

  If the `wait_resource` column is `RID` (Row Identifier), it indicates a wait for a specific row in **SQL Server**. `RID` is a unique ID that identifies a specific row in a table in SQL Server.

  > e.g. `RID: 1:1234:5678`

:::note

- `<file_id>` represents the ID of the data file.

- `<page_id>` represents the page ID.

- `<object_id>` represents the ID of the table.

- `<database_1d>` represents the ID of the database.

- `<key_id>` is the key ID.

- `<row_id>` represents an ID that identifies a row within the page.
