### Performance metrics filters

Performance metrics include the page load time, redirection time, download time, and such. You can perform query by applying thresholds to various performance metrics. Select the desired metrics from the <Cmdname sid="TTL08292" className="uitext" replace="ms" /> option, and then apply the thresholds and operator conditions.

- You can enter a positive number, negative number, or 0 as the threshold, but whether to enter a negative number may differ depending on the selected performance metrics.
