If you have created a database monitoring (DPM) project and an application monitoring (APM) project, you can relate the two projects for monitoring the data collected from DPM in the APM project.

You can check the details of the transaction in real time through active transactions of the application linked to the active session in the database. This integrated monitoring allows you to analyze the interactions between applications and databases in detail and diagnose and resolve performance bottlenecks in real time.

The <Cmdname sid="side_correlatedProjectManagement" className="uitext" /> feature allows you to go beyond product-/equipment-centric monitoring and view monitoring data across multiple projects. This is useful for analyzing how different system components such as applications and databases, interact together. In particular, when performance degradation occurs, you can quickly determine whether it is a hardware problem or an individual application problem, which can significantly reduce the troubleshooting time. Through <Cmdname sid="side_correlatedProjectManagement" className="uitext" />, you can comprehensively analyze performance data at the user system level and obtain more visible insights.
