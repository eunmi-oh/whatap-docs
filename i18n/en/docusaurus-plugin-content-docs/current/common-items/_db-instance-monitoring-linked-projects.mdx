### Checking the linked projects

In <Cmdname sid="side_correlatedProjectManagement" className="uitext" />, when another application project is added, the ![Correlations icon](/img/ic-correlations.svg) button is added to the active session entry.

<ImgLang img="db-instance-monitoring-linked-project.png" desc="Correlated project" />

Through the <Cmdname sid="TTL07046" className="uitext" /> window that appears when the ![Correlations icon](/img/ic-correlations.svg) button is selected, you can check active transactions of the applications linked to active sessions. You can check specific metrics such as transaction ID, thread ID, client IP, and CPU usage time, along with basic information such as transaction URL and database connection information, DB type, HTTP method, and execution time. Additionally, you can monitor the SQL query execution time, number of SQL calls, DB connection time, and such, which allows you to comprehensively analyze the system performance.

In particular, it provides the call stack information and SQL queries through stack traces, helping you trace and resolve detailed causes when problems occur. This allows you to perform in-depth analysis of interactions between applications and databases, and to quickly diagnose performance bottlenecks.
