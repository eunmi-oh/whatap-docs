![Leader line 1](/img/number-01.png) **Active transactions for each agent**

It displays a list of all application servers and the total number of active transactions. Hover your mouse over each graph on the chart to display the transaction speed. The speed of the transaction state is classified into <span class='normal'>Normal</span>, <span class='slow'>Slow</span>, and <span class='vslow'>Very Slow</span>.

![Leader line 2](/img/number-02.png) **Agent List**

It displays the application server list and the total number of active transactions. If you select the application server, In the ![Leader line 3](/img/number-03.png) transaction list, the detailed information appears.

It displays the detailed information of active transactions including URLs, SQLs, and HTTP calls. If you select the Top 10 Items tab, you can see a table of items sorted by the elapsed time in the ascending order.

When you select an item in the transaction list, the <Cmdname sid="active_transaction" className="uitext" /> window appears where you can see the details on the selected transaction.

<ImgLang img='dashboard-active-transaction-details.png' desc='Active Transaction' />

- You can see detailed information of the running transactions, external calls, queries, call stacks, and the like.

  - <Cmdname sid="refresh_all" className="uitext" />: You can update information of the running transactions.

  - <Cmdname sid="stop_thread" className="uitext" />: You can stop a transaction in progress. To stop threading, <Cmdname sid="secret_key" className="uitext" /> is required. For more information about <Cmdname sid="secret_key" className="uitext" />, see <Link to="install-agent#security">the following</Link>.

  - <Cmdname sid="BTN08518" className="uitext" />: You can query the SQL performance of the database linked to the active transaction. It appears only when the selected transaction is the one that executed SQL as a linked project. For more information about addition and management of the linked projects, see [the following](linked-projects).

  :::tip

  <Cmdname sid="stop_thread" className="uitext" /> forcibly stops threads running in the application. However, this feature may not work in all cases. For example, if a thread performs an IO operation, the thread cannot be stopped immediately.

  <Cmdname sid="stop_thread" className="uitext" /> attempts to terminate the thread even if it is performing an IO operation. However, the thread does not stop until it finishes its IO operation. The thread accepts the termination request, but it does not stop until its operation is completed and it goes to the next work.

  In this case, forcible termination is not recommended because it may cause problems with business logic and cause unexpected operations. If you need to stop the thread, stop and restart the entire application.

  :::

- If a transaction has already ended, the <Cmdname sid="show_trace" className="uitext" /> button appears. When you select the button, the <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window appears. For more information about <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" />, see [the following](trs-profile#transaction-info).
