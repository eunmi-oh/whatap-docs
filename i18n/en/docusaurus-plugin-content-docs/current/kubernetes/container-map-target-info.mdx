### Kubernetes status summary analysis {#kube-summary-analysis}

It provides a summary analysis report on the performance and resources for each container, Pod, and node in the Kubernetes environment. You can monitor the resource allocation and usage for containers, Pods, and nodes in the clusters and namespaces in real time and respond effectively by referencing the suggestions of the reports. 

:::note 

Currently, each summary analysis is available only in Korean.
