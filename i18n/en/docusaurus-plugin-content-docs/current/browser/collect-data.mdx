The WhaTap browser agent collects events that occur from each user's browser, reprocesses the collected data, and uses the data for monitoring. All collected data is user session dependent.

## Types

The following lists the types of data that the WhaTap browser agent collects.

- **Long**: A unique ID data type in the long to string32 format.
- **TimeStamp**: Time stamp upon measurement, in milliseconds (ms).
- **HighResolutionTime**: Elapsed time in milliseconds (ms)
- **TimeSet**: The start time stamp and the elapsed time are displayed for display of a timeline.
- It is any of **ResourceType** : `document`, `xhr`, `fetch`, `beacon`, `css`, `script`, `image`, `font`, `media`, and `other`.
- **ErrorType** : It is any of `console`, `onError`, `promiseRejection`, `fetchError`, `xhrError`, and `messageError`.

## Common collection data

When any event occurs, the collected basic data is as follows:

<div class='br-data'>

## Page load time {#pageloadtime}

[Pageload time](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Page_load_time) is the total time from the moment the web browser requests the URL of a page until all of the page's resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) are downloaded and processed, and the browser completely renders the page so that it is available.

To collect page load times, browser agents collect them through the **Navigation Timing API**, one of the web APIs provided by the browser. This API provides measurements of the times for each step (e.g. request start, response, rendering start and completion).

### Navigation timing

There are measurement events accessible through the [PerformanceTiming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming) interface that are measured in milliseconds. The following is a list of those events in the order in which they occur.

## Core Web Vitals Event

**Core Web Vitals** are three metrics that Google considers important, among various measurement values that affect the user experience of web content. The basic collection data is as follows:

<div class='br-data'>

| Data name |                     Type                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Example |
| --------- | :------------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| lcp       | <span class='type'>HighResolutionTime</span> | Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), which reports the rendering time of the largest image or text block within the viewport based on the first page loaded time.                                                                         | 12334   |
| fid       | <span class='type'>HighResolutionTime</span> | First Input Delay (FID), from the first time you interact with the page (e.g. clicking a link, tapping a button, or using a custom JavaScript-based control) to the time to start the event handler in response to that interaction. | 7       |
| cls       |       <span class='type'>Number</span>       | Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a score that quantifies the unexpected layout shifts caused by the dynamically loaded content.                                                                                                      | 2       |
