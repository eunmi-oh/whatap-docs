Database metrics are a comprehensive collection of database workloads and resource usages. The WhaTap monitoring service continuously collects metrics to identify bottlenecks in the database and provides data to help identify the root causes of performance issues.

For more information about other metrics, see [the link](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/).

| `wal_count`                 | Number of Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) records written. Spikes in the WAL file counts are usually caused by the large amount of changes in a short period or vacuum-like maintenance operations that generate temporary tables and objects. They should slowly return to normal levels. This usually results in lots of disk I/O and CPU activity, slowing the application query's execution until things get back to normal. This metric has the values queried every minute. | Performance |
| `warning_count`             | Number of warnings occurred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Info        |
