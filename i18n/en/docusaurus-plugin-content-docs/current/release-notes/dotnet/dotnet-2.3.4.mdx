- <Status priority='0'>Fixed</Status> Temporarily removed the CancellationToken-related methods from recently added monitoring targets.

- <Status priority='1'>New</Status> Added support for setting the `expand_transaction_level` in .NET Core.

  - **expand_transaction_level** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    If you set this option to `true`, SQL and HTTP calls that occur outside transactions are considered transactions and they are displayed in the hitmap.

  - **expand_transaction_basetime** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `1000` ms (1 second)

    When the `expand_transaction_level` option is set to `true`, data is collected only for requests that take longer to respond than the specified time. It collects up to 100 items per second. The minimum value is `100` ms (0.1 second).

- <Status priority='1'>New</Status> Added support for desktop application monitoring.

  - Set the value of the `expand_transaction_level` option to `true`.

  - Before running the application, enter the following command at the prompt:

    ```csharp
    SET COR_PROFILER={D76F1D76-A9E0-4C87-874F-C0AD93D4229B}
    SET COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1

    SET CORECLR_PROFILER={21CAE18A-4E44-4578-83FD-0576AAA47E68}
    SET CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1
    SET DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS=C:\Program Files\WhaTap .NET\core\Whatap.Startup.NetCore.dll

    SET WHATAP_TRACE_IIS_ONLY=0
    SET EXPAND_TRANSACTION_LEVEL=1
    SET EXPAND_TRANSACTION_BASETIME=100
    ```

  - After executing the command, run the target application. 

  :::note 

  Support for desktop application monitoring is in Beta stage and the upgrade is scheduled for the monitoring scope and usability.
